<h3>Kuala Lumpur Internation Airport(KLIA)</h3>

  <p>An uneventful Uber ride took us from our home in Cheras to KLIA under 45 minutes. We were a tad early for check in so we waited right by the business class dedicated check-in counter while the crew went about setting up.</p>

<h3>Plaza Premium Lounge</h3>
  <p>Srilankan doesn’t have its dedicated lounge for business class. Instead, we were redirected to the usual Plaza Premium Lounge in the Satellite terminal.</p>
  <p>We quickly secured a seat after checking in. The lounge was at its capacity even in the early hours, possibly because most airlines redirect their business class passengers here, and you gain complimentary access by holding certain credit cards (you could pay to get in too!).</p>
  <p>Having visited this lounge on most of our visits to KLIA, I must say the food does no justice to the brilliant food culture in Malaysia. Understandably, the lounge must operate within its constraints, although it surely can do better than subpar sushi. Nonetheless, I was thankful for the black olives and congee. Interestingly, we were offered free drinks by the reception. This wasn’t the experience I remembered during the last visit, but who could say no to more liquors!</p>

  <p>The lounge was evidently short-staffed as the toilet seat was wet. It was a poor display of workmanship and it left a bad taste to what could be the perfect start to our journey. Nevertheless, our overall experience here was satisfactory as we rested our body in anticipation of our maiden business class flight.</p>

<p>We were greeted by name as we board. Hot towel and champagne were promptly delivered as we settled in our seats. The seat cannot be reclined completely (read not a flatbed), but given the short flight time of 3.5 hours it was comfortable enough.</p>

<p>We were fast asleep as the plane took off. Soon after reaching cruising altitude, our meal was prepared and neatly presented, and quite flavorful I must say. On offering as well were the Chivas Regal 18 year old and 2015 Shiraz, all of which we duly indulged.</p>

<h3>Bandaranaike International Airport</h3>
<p>We had around 3 hours of transit time in Colombo, which gave us more than enough time to explore. Upon arrival at the Colombo airport, we were greeted by the iconic Buddha statue which signifies Buddhism as the major religion of the country. Along the way, there are many stores that sell precious gemstone and world famous Ceylon tea leaves.</p>

<p>We walked across a long terminal walkway to look for our lounge to catch a break and grab some refreshment.</p>

<h3>Lotus Lounge</h3>
<p>This time, we had complimentary access to Lotus Lounge thanks to Priority Pass. The lounge was neat and quiet. Ample selection of hot items and liquor were on display. There were free WiFi and phone charging station. Toilet was clean too.</p>

<p>To our surprise, the lamb curry was delicious. We were stuffed with all the airline meal, yet we still managed to devour two servings of lamb curry. The combination of biryani, crackers, and the savory lamb curry made us looked forward to return (which we did later in our return segment, but no lamb curry that time).</P>
