        <h3>Kuala Lumpur Internation Airport(KLIA)</h3>
          <p>An uneventful Uber ride took us from our home in Cheras to KLIA under 45 minutes. We were a tad early for check in so we waited right by the business class dedicated check-in counter while the crew went about setting up.</p>

              <br />
        <h3>Plaza Premium Lounge</h3>
          <p>Srilankan doesn’t have its dedicated lounge for business class. Instead, we were redirected to the usual Plaza Premium Lounge in the Satellite terminal.</p>
          <p>We quickly secured a seat after checking in. The lounge was at its capacity even in the early hours, possibly because most airlines redirect their business class passengers here, and you gain complimentary access by holding certain credit cards (you could pay to get in too!).</p>
          <p>Having visited this lounge on most of our visits to KLIA, I must say the food does no justice to the brilliant food culture in Malaysia. Understandably, the lounge must operate within its constraints, although it surely can do better than subpar sushi. Nonetheless, I was thankful for the black olives and congee. Interestingly, we were offered free drinks by the reception. This wasn’t the experience I remembered during the last visit, but who could say no to more liquors!</p>

              <br />
          <p>The lounge was evidently short-staffed as the toilet seat was wet. It was a poor display of workmanship and it left a bad taste to what could be the perfect start to our journey. Nevertheless, our overall experience here was satisfactory as we rested our body in anticipation of our maiden business class flight.</p>

          <p>We were greeted by name as we board. Hot towel and champagne were promptly delivered as we settled in our seats. The seat cannot be reclined completely (read not a flatbed), but given the short flight time of 3.5 hours it was comfortable enough.</p>

          <p>We had around 3 hours of transit time in Colombo, which gave us more than enough time to explore.

Along the way, there are many stores that sell precious gemstone and world famous Ceylon tea leaves.</p>

          <p>To our surprise, the lamb curry was delicious. We were stuffed with all the airline meal, yet we still managed to devour two servings of lamb curry. The combination of biryani, crackers, and the savory lamb curry made us looked forward to return (which we did later in our return segment, but no lamb curry that time).</P>

        <h3>CMB > MLE: Srilankan Airlines 115</h3>
          <p>This was one of the few occasions where I wished the flight was longer. The business class layout in UL 115 was the familiar 1–2–1 seen in most other airlines. It baffled me that an one-hour flight has a better layout than a three-hour flight, and I very much would swap this experience with the previous segment in a heartbeat.</p>
          <p>The seat was much more spacious and personal, with the diagonal arrangement providing ample privacy. The seat can be laid back to 180 degree which transformed it to a flatbed. Plenty of room to store small suitcases or your personal electronics.</p>
          <p>Before long, (yet another) meal was served. Again, it was delectable. But I was too stuffed to enjoy the meal in the entirety that it deserved. Malé was in sight as time flew by in bliss.</p>

        <h3>Velana International Airport</h3>
          <p>Still, there was no direct link bridge from the aircraft to the terminal building. Velana International Airport was even smaller than CMB, no doubt due to the limitation in land mass as the airport is in fact on an island. We took time to fill up the custom declaration form, I was taken aback when I found that I had to declare what vaccination I did, only to realize it was required only for people from certain African countries. The queue wasn’t particularly long, but it still took us about half an hour to go through. Worse still, Velana International Airport has no air-conditioning in the public area. I was fairly tired after an early flight and the humid hot weather didn’t help.</p>

          <p>The Wellness lounge was like an oasis in the middle of the desert. I felt rejuvenated by the cooling air, fresh cookies (it’s really delicious!), refreshing juice, and great hospitality of the staff.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, free WiFi to connect to the rest of the world!</p>

        <h3>Check-in at the Conrad Booth</h3>
          <p>It felt surreal when you planned a dream vacation for months and finally you are ready to embark. First stop was the Conrad booth in the airport.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid lazy portrait"  src="img/placeholder/maldives/arrival/booth.jpg" data-src="img/resized/maldives/arrival/booth.jpg" alt="Conrad Maldives booth in Velana International Airport.">

              <br />
          <p>Close to our arrival date, a Conrad representative communicated with us on the details regarding the seaplane transfer, along with an allotted time to check in. We tried to check in an hour earlier assuming we could enjoy the lounge longer but it was in vain. So, we camped in a nearby cafe to kill time.</p>
          <p>When we return, our luggages were tagged and we were brought to the seaplane check in counter. After weighing the luggage, the staff directed us to a shuttle van which brought us to the Conrad lounge. Our time here was short, and we wished we could stay longer because the decorations in the lounge were exquisite and the food palatable.</p>

          <p>Conrad had little control over the schedule and they relied on the seaplane company to notify us when we would depart. We were asked to sign a consensus document and were given our boarding pass. In less than 15 minutes, we were transported to the departure platform next to the harbor. The red white seaplane was readily waiting for our arrival. We hopped onto the seaplane and it took off slowly. The cabin was really tiny but it could fit up to 15 people. Prime spots for good aerial pictures would be the front window seats before the turbine. The 45 minutes flight was fraught with sights of atolls and intriguing island formations.</p>

        <h3>Arrival</h3>
          <p>We landed in front of a small hut in the middle of the link bridge between two islands. The friendly staff of Conrad Maldives had been waiting for us with refreshing cold towel and bottled water. Every group of guests was assigned an island host that will take care of all needs during their stay in Conrad Maldives. We were fortunate to have Olga as our island host. She led us to the reception area via the long-stretching link bridge, while explaining about the resort and its facilities. To ensure we did not lose ourselves in the free-flowing time in paradise, Olga gently reminded us to update our clocks as Conrad Maldives is one hour ahead of Malé.</p>

          <p>The floor in the reception area was covered with sand, and to my surprise the sand was not as fine as I imagined. While not too coarse, it wasn’t the most comfortable sand to step on. Olga sat us down and handed us a letter detailing the complimentary benefits we could enjoy as Hilton Honors Diamond members.</p>

        <p>A pot of water to clean our sandy feet first greeted us at the end of the corridor to the entrance of our room. Upon entering the room, a gust of refreshing cool air immediately brushed away our fatigue from the long journey. A bottle of champagne, an assorted chocolate box, and a fruit basket were set on a table next to a resting sofa.</p>

        <p>When we looked up, an opening on the ceiling right above the sofa provided plenty of natural light. Next to the resting sofa was a walk-in changing room. Opposite the room were his and hers wash basins equipped with tall mirrors and Shanghai Tang bath amenities. Behind, we found an open-air shower area and a square bathtub under a pavilion. Matches and candles were provided to enhance the romantic atmosphere, which we found useful at night (wink).</p>

        <p>We fell in love with the warm preparation done by Conrad Maldives staff when we saw the honeymoon decoration on the king-size bed. Laying on the comfy bed, we could watch movies and various international channels from the wall-mounted TV. A drink station well supplied with complimentary bottled water, Dilmah Exceptional tea collection, and a Nespresso machine with diverse coffee capsules. Under the drink station were drawers that stored silverware, as well as a mini bar.</p>

        <p>On the left of the bed was a wall of floor-to-ceiling glass window. Beyond the glass sliding door, a couple of sunbeds were furnished on the small wooden platform. A smooth stone path led us through a minuscule patch of trees to our private beach area with another set of sunbeds and an umbrella. The access to the sea was so convenient, we could literally jump into the sea anytime. The calf-deep sea was calm until we reached the wave breakers about 20 meter from the shore. Further, we felt stronger current and saw more marine life.</p>

        <p>We stayed two nights in Superior Water Villa, a wooden hut etched on the seafloor. Coming from Malaysia where wooden hut is a fairly common traditional house, the wooden hut structure was not impressive. We were first assigned to a villa where half of the sea view was blocked by the Over Water Spa next to us. In addition, the close proximity to the spa was a privacy concern: we could clearly see what’s going on around the spa and reciprocally they could see all of the activities in our room if we didn’t close the curtains. Once again, if you never ask you will never know what you can get. We requested to switch to another villa further away from the spa. After a few hours, Olga managed to get another villa that met our request.</p>

      <h3>Interior</h3>
        <p>The Superior Water Villa was significantly smaller than the Beach Villa. That said, standard amenities such as his and hers wash basins, a separate toilet area, a transparent shower room, and a bathtub can still be found here. A small beverage station, a sofa, and an armchair were furnished in the bedroom, along with the comfortable king size bed.</p>

      <h3>Deck</h3>
        <p>The most exciting part of the Superior Water Villa was the deck where we could appreciate the scenery at different times of the day. The deck had a staircase that directly descended to the sea. A shower head was attached at the side for us to rinse off the saltwater after a dip in the sea. Occasionally, schools of fish can be spotted around the villa in the turquoise waters.</p>

      <h3>Comparison with Beach Villa</h3>
        <p>While we loved the easy access to the sea and the superior sea view, we preferred the overall layout of the Beach Villa, none other than the fact that the Beach Villa is almost twice the size of Superior Water Villa. We were glad to taste the novelty of staying in a water villa, but for future travels we are more than likely to settle in a landed room. Nevertheless, we wished for more nights to enjoy the Jacuzzi!</p>

      <h3>Breakfast option A: Atoll Market</h3>
        <i>07:00–10:30</i>
        <p>In the morning, we usually headed to Atoll Market for breakfast buffet which consisted of a conglomeration of international cuisines. The buffet had various sections such as Chinese, Maldivian, American, pastries, cheese and cold cuts, make-to-order omelets, salad, and fresh fruits. It also housed a juice station where we could customize our own juices.</p>

      <h3>Breakfast option B: Vilu Restaurant</h3>
        <i>07:00–10:30</i>
        <p>On the occasion where we didn’t feel like having a buffet for breakfast, we went to Vilu Restaurant for à la carte options and a change of scenery. In addition to the two à la carte orders per person, we could enjoy complimentary breakfast essentials such as juices, assorted pastries, and cold cuts. I was deeply disappointed with the chawanmushi; the side rice sushi was super hard and the chawanmushi was without any toppings or ingredients other than eggs. Chubby, on the other hand, fell wholeheartedly in love with the Oyster Rockefeller.</p>

      <h3>Afternoon tea at Mandhoo</h3>
        <i>16:00–17:00</i>
        <p>We looked forward to afternoon tea at Mandhoo Spa Restaurant every day. The menu changed every day but it revolved around all the bite-size goodies you could imagine such as finger sandwich, scones, cream, marmalade, tarts, and cakes. In addition, a wide range of Dilmah Exceptional teas and selection of Evian still water and sparkling water were available.</p>

      <h3>Happy Hour at Vilu</h3>
          <i>17:00 -18:00</i>
        <p>After the afternoon tea, we rang a buggy from Mandhoo Spa Restaurant to Vilu Restaurant at the opposite island for happy hour. The setting is a lot more vibrant with mixed groups of couples and families with their children. While watching their children playing sand and swimming at the seaside, the parents got to enjoy free flow of beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. Each guest is served with complimentary canapé that was different every day.</p>
        <p>The scenery is phenomenal. It was relaxing to enjoy the breeze and appreciate the sea view. Every half hour or so, the dhoni ferried more guests to join the happy hour session. Once in a while, we would take a sip of the liquor of our choice, watch the dhoni glides gracefully across the calm water, and devour the canapés.</p>

      <h3>Dinner</h3>
        <p>This is bound to disappoint, but we didn’t have any proper dinner for the entire week (bar the paid cheese fondue at The Cheese and Wine Bar and the free honeymoon dinner at Mandhoo Spa Restaurant).</p>
        <p>Leaning against the non-allergic feather pillow and reposing on the luxurious king size bed, we were binge-watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy while devouring curry flavored instant noodles — Not because we wanted to but because we had to! Even with fifteen dining selections on site, ranging from the “affordable” Rangali Bar to the world’s first all-glass Ithaa Undersea Restaurant, unfortunately we couldn’t afford to enjoy most of them (a decent meal for one could easily run up to USD 50 after tax).</p>
        <p>So how did we survive the staggering food bill? A luggage of instant food! For your inspiration, we brought canned tuna, bread, instant noodles, instant porridge, and various snacks. It may not be the ideal or glamorous way to spend our honeymoon; yet, it was somehow satisfying and interesting to consume junk food and had movie marathon in an extravagant setting.</p>

            <br />
        <p>We were really excited to indulge in the cheese fondue at the Cheese and Wine Bar, which reportedly serves over 100 types of cheeses from all around the world. When we first entered restaurant, we were overwhelmed by a thick cheese odor. Chubby thought it was aromatic but I thought they could have cleared the odor every time after each dining service. The restaurant only has a long dining table and it is surrounded by three walls of wine. I initially expected to have a private table and a romantic dining experience. We were a little bit uncomfortable when we were seated in between two pairs of unknown couples sharing the same table with close proximity to each other.</p>
        <p>While we waited for our meal, everyone in the room was exceptionally quiet because conversation could be eavesdropped by anyone. Luckily, we can converse in Mandarin and we hoped the couples sitting next to us couldn’t understand. After what felt like an eternity, I couldn’t stand the staring and waiting. Thus, the socially awkward me had to step up the social game. We struck up conversation with the couples and had interesting chats, only to realize we all booked Conrad Maldives with points! In between our small talks, our appetizer was served.</p>

            <br />
        <p>The cheese soup was not exactly creamy, yet the flavor was intense and concentrated, like a diluted cream soup that is made entirely of cheese. On the side, small slices of fruits complemented the special starter to our evening.</p>

        <p>The cheese fondue was finally set up! We were ecstatic to see a pot of melting goodies that was made of a combination of three different types of cheese. Cheese fondue is typically prepared with white wine, but in Conrad Maldives it was with champagne. Complimentary bread cubes, pickles, and potatoes were served as sides to be dipped with cheese.</p>
        <p>Lemon sorbet was our dessert for the day, along with port wine and its intriguing origin told by our sommelier. I could tell the others were not too impressed with the port wine because it was too sweet.</p>

        <p>Overall we splurged around USD 300 for the meal! Did the price justify the whole experience? For what was a novel experience, we wished the seating to be more intimate. Chubby rated the meal 8.5 out of 10. I, on the other hand, wished they would provide more varieties of side dishes such as cherry tomatoes or mushroom. It wasn’t filling enough, so we binged on instant noodles to cure the cravings.</p>

      <br />
        <p>In comparison to the paid <a href="#cheese-fondue">cheese fondue dinner</a>, the long awaited complimentary three-course honeymoon dinner at Mandhoo Spa Restaurant on our last night was magical! The romantic ambience, delicate cuisine, and attentive hostess made for an unforgettable experience of a lifetime.</p>
        <p>The dinner started before the twilight. We were seated at an outdoor platform just above the sea. The waitress introduced herself and revealed the menu for the night.</p>

        <p>While we were watching the sunset and actively attempting to spot marine lives, a few freshly baked oats and nuts buns were served with pumpkin dipping sauce. Next, battered fried shrimp with lotus root was delivered to our table. I was surprised that lotus root, a common Asian ingredient, appeared in a western dish.</p>

        <p>As time passed, the sea swallowed the sun in a fleeting moment. Like a spectacular orchestra, the clouds roared and the sky changed in a godly speed from gold, to orange, to indigo, to pitch black. Afterwards, the full moon steadily ascended and the moonlight gently reflected on the surface of the sea. The serenity was remarkable and it formed an indelible memory that I would savor for years to come.</p>

        <p>Before long, warm calamari and reef fish fillet on the plancha were presented. I was skeptical about the calamari because it is usually overcooked and tough like a rubber. This time, the pan-seared calamari was tender and juicy. It won my heart instantaneously.</p>

        <p>Next on the menu was sage marinated chicken. As the supposed star of the meal, we thought the flavor of the chicken was rather mediocre. It certainly was overshadowed by the complexity of the calamari we had. By the time I finished, my stomach was bloated.</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, I reserved space for dessert, which happened to be caramelized tofu cheesecake with orange kumquat confit. I started with the fruit soup with tapioca. Its sour taste eased my bloated tummy and refreshed my palette. The pudding in the middle was a good transition to the main dessert, the organic cheesecake. The acidic orange kumquat confit provided a nice balance with the creamy cheesecake.</p>

        <p>Since our flight back to Kuala Lumpur would not depart until 8:45 pm, Conrad Maldives had graciously extended our check-out time to 4:00 pm, and even though they had little control on the schedule of the third-party seaplane, they did their utmost to arrange a late seaplane departure so that we did not have to spend much time in the airport.</p>
        <p>Because the weather was hot, the staff was kind enough to offer us to wait for the seaplane in the Business Centre right above the lobby. We did not even know of the existence of such facility! It had a small library, two Macs, and an assortment of light refreshment such as water, juice, and cookies. In the blazing climate in Maldives, the air-conditioning in the Business Centre was a godsend. By the time of departure, Ms. Olga, our island host came to bid us farewell.</p>

      <h3>Srilankan Airline 104 MLE-CMB</h3>
        <p>Our departure flight from Malé to Colombo had the exact layout as our incoming flight UL115 from Colombo to Malé. The one-hour flight flew by, and before we knew it, we had landed in Colombo.</p>
      <h3>Srilankan Airline 318 CMB-KUL</h3>
        <p>As we dragged our exhausted body over to the gate, I was pleasantly surprised when we were informed that we have been upgraded to business class! Chubby had the audacity to claim he had sixth sense where he knew this would happen.</p>
        <p>The cabin layout was the same as our incoming flight UL319 from Kuala Lumpur to Colombo. While it was not as posh as the 1–2–1 configuration seen on the previous segment, more legroom and comfort for a midnight flight back home were more than welcomed.</p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>We thoroughly reveled in our honeymoon in Conrad Maldives. Once we got into a routine of breakfast, snorkeling, more food, and movies, it didn’t feel like a vacation. It felt like we were in our backyard spending whole day doing nothing (I’d kill to have a backyard like this).</p>
        <p>Looking back, we could have done much more to maximize our trip experience. First, we wished we took more photos to complement this trip report. We realized that we severely lacked quality photos for most of the facilities and activities. Second, it was my first time using a GoPro, and all of the videos taken were shaky. Thus, my plan of shooting awesome videos went down the drain. Next, we should really try out new activities other than snorkeling. Paddle boarding and kayaking were complimentary for our utilization yet we were too indifferent and relaxed to explore.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we should take extra effort to remember the names of all the staff whom we had received exceptional service. It was rude of us to not be able to give credit where credit is due. We would like to take this opportunity to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all Conrad staff whom effort made our trip marvelous. Special thanks reserved for Ms. Olga who went above and beyond to spoil us during our stay in Conrad Maldives.</p>
